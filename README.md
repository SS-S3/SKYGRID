Based on the research papers we have referred the idea is very much effective and open to innovations

The field is not very much explored and hence dataset limitations and hardware costing needs to be tackled

We will collect data from these operations to further enhance the model and also work on custom drones if needed

The software enhances life-saving efforts by accelerating rescue operations, optimizing search efficiency.

It reduces costs by minimizing helicopter usage and avoiding resource expenditure in pre-evacuated areas.
